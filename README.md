# Experiment 7 - Dynamic Content Filtering

### 🎯 Task
Create a simple list of items (like movies or products) and implement real-time filtering using JavaScript.

---

### 📋 Requirements
- Display a list of items using HTML.
- Add an input field for searching.
- Use JavaScript array methods (`filter()` or `includes()`) to filter the items.
- Update results in real-time as the user types.

---

### 💻 Files Included
- **index.html** → Structure of the web page  
- **style.css** → Styling for the list and input field  
- **script.js** → Logic for filtering and updating the list  
- **README.md** → This file (project details)

---

### ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the folder in **VS Code**.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Right-click and select **“Open with Live Server”** (or double-click it to open in browser).
4. Start typing in the search box — the list updates instantly.

---

### 🚀 Output Example
When you type `"a"`, only items containing the letter “a” will be shown in the list.

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- DOM Manipulation  
- Event Handling (`input` event)  
- Array Methods (`filter()`, `includes()`)
